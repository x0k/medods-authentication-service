## Feedback

### From reviewer

- We are not prepared to offer you a place on this vacancy
- There is no comment from the developer

### From myself

- This is a really bad task for a **junior developer**.

  Even if it's a simulation of a real task (giving juniors security related tasks, seriously?) - I think it's not the right way to find junior developers.
